# Final Import Path Fixes

## Dynamic Import Issues Fixed

### In `src/js/core/game.js`

Fixed 2 dynamic imports that were still using incorrect relative paths:

1. **Line 609**: Quest Turn-In UI
   - ❌ Before: `import('./ui/questTurnIn.js')`
   - ✅ After: `import('../ui/questTurnIn.js')`

2. **Line 620**: Particle Effects
   - ❌ Before: `import('./ui/particles.js')`  
   - ✅ After: `import('../ui/particles.js')`

## Why These Were Missed

Dynamic imports using `import()` function were not caught in the initial search because they use a different syntax than static imports. Static imports use `import ... from`, while dynamic imports use `import()`.

## All Import Types Now Fixed

✅ **Static imports** - All `import ... from` statements  
✅ **Dynamic imports** - All `import()` function calls  
✅ **Side-effect imports** - All `import 'module'` statements

## Verification

The game should now load without any 404 errors. Make sure to:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Restart the development server if needed

## File Structure Reminder

```
src/js/
├── core/         # game.js is here
│   └── game.js   
├── ui/           # questTurnIn.js and particles.js are here
│   ├── questTurnIn.js
│   └── particles.js
```

Since `game.js` is in `core/` and needs to import from `ui/`, it must use `../ui/` not `./ui/`.
