# Engine Integration Completion Summary

## Date: 2025-08-31

## âœ… All Tasks Completed Successfully

### What Was Done:

1. **Integrated Enhanced Engine System**
   - Merged all functionality from `engine-update/` into main `engine/` directory
   - Successfully removed `engine-update/` folder after verification
   - All rules and features working correctly

2. **Fixed Critical Bugs**
   - Fixed unreachable 'b' handler in keys.js (removed early return)
   - Fixed double status processing (removed duplicate tick)
   - Fixed Map/Array synchronization for status effects
   - Fixed SPD display to show actual modified value
   - Fixed NaN display in status effects

3. **Added Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created in-game test commands (Press T, then Shift+1 through Shift+9)
   - Created browser-based test suite at `/test-engine.html`
   - Added extensive console logging for debugging
   - All tests passing successfully

4. **Key Features Working**
   - âœ… Water extinguishes fire
   - âœ… Freeze prevents movement
   - âœ… Stat modifiers (weaken/armor)
   - âœ… Wet + Electric = Instant Kill (99999 damage)
   - âœ… Water tiles make entities conductive
   - âœ… Status stacking and proper expiration
   - âœ… All engine phases executing correctly

### File Structure (Final):
```
src/js/engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ adapters/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cavesOfOoo.js      # Game adapter with enhanced logging
â”œâ”€â”€ materials.js           # Material and status registry
â”œâ”€â”€ rules.js              # Rule utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ sim.js                # Core engine with phases
â”œâ”€â”€ statusDefinitions.js  # All status definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ statusRegistry.js     # Registry compatibility layer
â”œâ”€â”€ statusRules.js        # Interaction rules
â”œâ”€â”€ testRules.instantKillWetElectric.js  # Test rule
â””â”€â”€ universalRules.js     # Universal rules (placeholder)
```

### How to Test:

1. **In-Game Testing:**
   - Press `T` to see test menu
   - Press `Shift+1` through `Shift+9` for specific tests
   - Watch console for detailed logs

2. **Browser Test Suite:**
   - Open http://localhost:8000/test-engine.html
   - Click individual test buttons or "RUN ALL TESTS"
   - Results show pass/fail status

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Press `b` to apply burn
   - Press `p` for poison
   - Press `e` for shock
   - Step into water tiles (~) to become conductive
   - Apply shock while wet for instant kill

### Console Logging System:

The system provides comprehensive logging with these prefixes:
- `[STATUS-SYSTEM]` - Status effect lifecycle
- `[ENGINE-SNAPSHOT]` - Entity snapshot building
- `[ENGINE]` - Rule evaluation and actions
- `[TURN-END]` - End of turn processing
- `[DAMAGE]` - Damage application
- `[KEYS]` - Input handling

### Documentation Created:

1. `ENGINE_VERIFICATION.md` - Verification checklist
2. `ENGINE_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Detailed test results
3. `test-engine.html` - Interactive test suite
4. `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

The enhanced engine system is fully integrated and operational. The `engine-update` folder has been successfully removed, and all features are working as expected. The system is now more maintainable with declarative rules that can be extended without modifying core code.
